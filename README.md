This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of hospital operations, patient demographics, and treatment outcomes across major healthcare facilities.

## Entity Relationship Diagram

## 1. General Overview

- **Total admissions** are evenly distributed across **Elective (18,655)**, **Urgent (18,576)**, and **Emergency (18,269)** cases.
- **Average hospital stay** is approximately **15.5 days**, with **treatment costs** averaging **$25,500** per patient.
- **Readmission rates** are moderate, with most patients returning due to chronic or complex health conditions.

## 2. Patient Demographics

- **Female patients** represent a slightly higher share of total admissions.
- The majority of patients fall within the **middle-aged to senior** categories, aligning with higher incidences of chronic illnesses such as **Diabetes, Hypertension, and Arthritis**.
- **Regional patterns** indicate relatively uniform patient distribution across hospitals, with no major geographical bias.

## 3. Hospital Performance

- **Houston Methodist Hospital** treated the most patients (**20,402**) but has a **lower normal result percentage (~9.8%)**, suggesting a higher concentration of complex cases.
- Other major centers like **Johns Hopkins**, **UCLA Medical Center**, and **Massachusetts General Hospital** maintain consistent performance levels with **~10% normal result rates**.
- The data indicates **comparable quality and patient outcomes** across top-performing hospitals.

## 4. Treatment & Medication Patterns

- Across all major conditions (Diabetes, Hypertension, Arthritis, Asthma, Cancer, and Obesity), the **top five prescribed medications** remain consistent:
  **Paracetamol, Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Penicillin, and Lipitor.**
- **Houston Methodist Hospital** leads in prescription volume across most conditions, suggesting higher patient throughput or broader treatment capacity.
- Medication usage is **highly consistent across hospitals**, implying standardized treatment protocols nationwide.

## 5. Admission Type & Cost Impact

- **Elective, Urgent, and Emergency admissions** have nearly identical average stays (15 days) and treatment costs ($25.5K).
- This consistency implies that **treatment intensity**, not admission urgency, primarily drives hospital costs.

## 6. Insurance Provider Performance

- **Medicare** covers the largest share of patients (**27,750**, ~50% of total), followed by **UnitedHealthCare (16,650)**, **Aetna (5,550)**, and **Cigna (5,550)**.
- **Treatment costs** remain stable across providers ($25.4K‚Äì$25.7K).
- **Outcomes distribution** (‚âà10% normal, 60% abnormal, 30% inconclusive) is similar for all insurers, showing minimal variation in care quality by insurance type.

## 7. Key Takeaways

- **Cost and care quality are consistent** across hospitals, admission types, and insurance providers.
- **Houston Methodist Hospital** is the busiest and handles a significant share of complex cases.
- **Chronic diseases** (Diabetes, Hypertension, Arthritis) dominate hospital admissions.
- **Treatment protocols and medication choices** are largely standardized across facilities.
- **Insurance coverage** influences patient volume more than treatment outcomes.

**Overall Insight:**  
The healthcare system demonstrates strong consistency in cost, treatment quality, and clinical practices across major hospitals and insurers, with performance variations driven more by patient case complexity than institutional differences.
