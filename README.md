## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Patient Demographics

![Patient Demographics](<Images/Patient Demographics.png>)

- **Female patients** represent a slightly higher share of total admissions.
- The majority of patients fall within the **middle-aged to senior** categories, aligning with higher incidences of chronic illnesses such as **Diabetes and Hypertension**.

## Hospital Performance

- **Houston Methodist Hospital** treated the most patients (**20,402**) but has a **lower normal result percentage (~9.8%)**, suggesting a higher concentration of complex cases.
- Other major centers like **Johns Hopkins**, **UCLA Medical Center**, and **Massachusetts General Hospital** maintain consistent performance levels with **~10% normal result rates**.

## Treatment & Medication Patterns

- Across all major conditions (Diabetes, Hypertension, Arthritis, Asthma, Cancer, and Obesity), the **top five prescribed medications** remain consistent:
  **Paracetamol, Aspirin, Ibuprofen, Penicillin, and Lipitor.**
- **Houston Methodist Hospital** leads in prescription volume across most conditions, suggesting higher patient throughput or broader treatment capacity.
- Medication usage is **highly consistent across hospitals**, implying standardized treatment protocols nationwide.

## Admission Type & Cost Impact

- **Elective, Urgent, and Emergency admissions** have nearly identical average stays (15 days) and treatment costs ($25.5K).
- This consistency implies that **treatment intensity**, not admission urgency, primarily drives hospital costs.

## Insurance Provider Performance

- **Medicare** covers the largest share of patients (**27,750**, ~50% of total), followed by **UnitedHealthCare (16,650)**, **Aetna (5,550)**, and **Cigna (5,550)**.
- **Treatment costs** remain stable across providers ($25.4K–$25.7K).
- **Outcomes distribution** (≈10% normal, 60% abnormal, 30% inconclusive) is similar for all insurers, showing minimal variation in care quality by insurance type.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Cost and care quality are consistent** across hospitals, admission types, and insurance providers.
- **Houston Methodist Hospital** is the busiest and handles a significant share of complex cases.
- **Chronic diseases** (Diabetes, Hypertension, Arthritis) dominate hospital admissions.
- **Treatment protocols and medication choices** are largely standardized across facilities.
- **Insurance coverage** influences patient volume more than treatment outcomes.

---

## Overall Insight

The healthcare system demonstrates strong consistency in cost, treatment quality, and clinical practices across major hospitals and insurers, with performance variations driven more by patient case complexity than institutional differences.
